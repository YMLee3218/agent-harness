description: >
  Decomposes requirements into VSA features and DDD domain concepts before any spec or code is written. Trigger when the user has confirmed they want to start work on a new feature or modification — not during exploratory discussion or open-ended questions. Typical triggers: "let's build X", "we need to add Y", "change the behaviour of Z", "I want to implement X". Do not trigger on vague curiosity ("what if we did X?") or questions without a committed direction. For a brand-new empty repo with no src/ structure yet, prefer `initializing-project` first. Always run this before writing-spec.

# Brainstorming Workflow

Determine first: is this a **new feature** or a **modification**?

---

## New Feature Flow

### Step 1 — Clarify

Use `EnterPlanMode`, then `Glob` `features/` to find reusable existing features.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to resolve ambiguity — at most three questions per turn:
- "What does success look like?"
- "What external systems or events are involved?"
- "What are the failure cases?"

Stay in plan mode. Do not proceed to Step 2 until behaviour, conditions, and outcomes are clear.

### Step 2 — Decompose

Classify each candidate:

```
Small feature = calls one or a few domains; single responsibility
Large feature = composes small features into a higher-level flow
```

Name format: Features: `{verb}-{noun}` kebab-case. Domain concepts: `{noun}` singular kebab-case.

List each candidate with its layer assignment.

Write the decomposition to the plan file. Call `ExitPlanMode` to request approval.

### Step 3 — Write Output and Create Branch

After approval, create `docs/requirements/{name}.md`:

```markdown
# {Requirement Name}

## Business Goal
{One sentence}

## Small Features
- `{verb}-{noun}`: {description}

## Large Features
- `{verb}-{noun}`: {which small features it composes}

## Reused Existing Features
- {list or "none"}

## Out of Scope
- {explicitly excluded items}
```

Before creating the feature branch, check for these conditions and use `AskUserQuestion` if any apply:
- **Not a git repo**: `git rev-parse --git-dir` fails → ask the user whether to initialise one first.
- **Dirty working tree**: `git status --porcelain` returns changes → ask whether to stash or commit before branching.
- **Branch already exists**: `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/feature/{name}` succeeds → ask whether to reuse or choose a different name.

Then create the feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/{name}
```

### Step 4 — Run critic-feature

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "critic-feature",
  prompt: "Review docs/requirements/{name}.md.
           Original requirement: [paste requirement]."
)
```

If Critic returns FAIL:
1. Output the full verdict to the user
2. Write a fix plan (reclassifications, renamed features, missing features to add)
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the fix plan before editing
4. Apply fixes with `Edit`
5. Re-run `critic-feature` via `Task` with the same requirements doc and original requirement

---

## Modification Flow

### Step 1 — Identify Impact

Use `EnterPlanMode`, then:
- `Read` relevant `docs/requirements/*.md`
- `Read` relevant `docs/*.md` — domain knowledge (SOT)
- `Glob` to list `features/` and `domain/` directories

Do not read implementation code — read `docs/` only.

Check whether the modification conflicts with existing `docs/*.md`:
- If the requirement changes domain rules documented in `docs/*.md`, those docs must be updated first (SOT).
- List which `docs/*.md` files need updating and what changes are required.

Use `AskUserQuestion` if the scope of change is unclear.

Write impact list to plan file. Include any required `docs/*.md` updates. Call `ExitPlanMode` to request approval.

### Step 2 — Update Docs (if needed)

If Step 1 identified `docs/*.md` conflicts, update the affected `docs/*.md` files first (SOT).

### Step 3 — Write Output and Run critic-feature

Create `docs/requirements/{name}.md` with the impact list.

Apply the same git pre-check (not a git repo / dirty tree / branch exists) from New Feature Flow Step 3 before running:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/{name}
```

Then run:

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "critic-feature",
  prompt: "Review docs/requirements/{name}.md.
           Original requirement: [paste requirement]."
)
```

If Critic returns FAIL, apply the same fix loop as New Feature Flow Step 4.

## Hard Stop

Do not move to `writing-spec` until:
- Every feature has a verb-noun name
- Every feature is classified as small or large
- Layer assignment is stated for each
- User has approved via `ExitPlanMode`
- `critic-feature` returns PASS
